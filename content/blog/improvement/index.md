The last couple weeks have had a definite theme for me of improvement. My company hosted a guest speaker to discuss better control of one's life and how to make incremental improvements. I also have been debating with some career decisions and the necessary improvemnts I would have to make to persue those. Happily, I had a week off in the ever beautiful Hawaii to weigh these thoughts. 

I have seen some traits recently in others that I see in myself. THese are not traits I'm particularlly fond of, but I have never tried to improvement either. I think sometimes exterior perspective is necessary for these types of things to really sink in. I don't feel the need to name theme here, but I'm going to be mindful about making these changes, these improvements, over the next few weeks. 

Some of these improvements I've been pondering
