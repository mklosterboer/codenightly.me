The last couple weeks have had a definite theme for me of improvement. My company hosted a guest speaker to discuss better control of one's life and how to make incremental improvements. I also have been debating with some career decisions and the necessary improvemnts I would have to make to persue those. Happily, I had a week off in the ever beautiful Hawaii to weigh these thoughts. 

I have seen some traits recently in others that I see in myself. THese are not traits I'm particularlly fond of, but I have never tried to improvement either. I think sometimes exterior perspective is necessary for these types of things to really sink in. I don't feel the need to name theme here, but I'm going to be mindful about making these changes, these improvements, over the next few weeks. 

With a great deal of irony, I think one improvemnt I need to work on is contentment. I tend to try for improvement furiously. Not necessarily because I want to, but because I fear the consequencies if I don't. There is no peak to this mountain. That is dangerous. I need to be more focused on achaiveable and productive goals. 

To this end, the improvements I will be seekig are not to learn a new framework or start another project. They will also not be work problems. To the contrary, I will be working towards seperating my self-worth from my career knowledge and aptitude. If I look obectively, I am performing well on that front, but have been letting other areas suffer. The pursuit of that one goal
